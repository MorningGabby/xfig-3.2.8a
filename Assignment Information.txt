TASK ENHANCED ROTATION

DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS: https://github.com/VCU-ERB/xfig-3.2.8a/issues/1

GOAL:  This project aims to unlock the predefined angles xFig.  Xfig has currently locked
the rotation angles to  90 and 180 angles,  you need to change that to accept any angles.
So the project would be removing the predefined angles and let xfig accept float numbers.

STEPS:
1. Open Visual Studio Code or your choice of IDE (open it from GitHub).
2. Check if you have opened the whole xfig folder.
3. Click on the search icon on the left toolbar and search  "#taskEnhancedRotation".  You
   should see two files with the hashtag.
4. Use the directions provided as comments to work on the assignment.
5. Go to the desktop and compile you code double-clicking the  'compile.sh' file to check
   if your solution works.

HOW TO CHECK:  To change the values of the angles  click on 'rotate' at the left toolbar.
Then, at the bottom, click on 'Rotn Angle' box and change the angle to check if it works.
If your code does not work,  try to check on your work and look for errors or try to redo
your work.

If you are confused at any point with xFig or linux environment, check the Youtube video
